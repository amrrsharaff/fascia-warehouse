A classroom-based project which is essentially a system for a warehouse which receives a list of orders of Fascia for cars and it produces the fascia accordingly.
The project was made by me and three other students and we used git to maintain our code.
-16orders.txt files represent the orders which the warehouse receives.
-duties.txt represent the duties which each person made in the project.
-The project had two stages where index.html was the first assignment and phase2.html was the second one with different requirements.
-Design.pdf contains a UML diagram of the project.
-translation.csv and traversal_table.csv are files which contain information which we use in the project in the correct format.

To run the program go to the project folder from the terminal and run these two commands
cd src
javac Reader.java
java Reader
Or for more details, go to project/help.txt
