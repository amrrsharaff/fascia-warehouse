To run the program go to the project folder from the terminal and run these two commands
cd src
javac Reader.java
java Reader


NOTES:
1- If you do not enter any command line arguments, the 16orders.txt file will be automatically read.
2- If you do enter any command line arguments, make sure you put the file in the right place and provide the file path with it.
3- The sequencer and the loader both rescan and fix any errors they find while rescanning.
4- During sequencing, had there been an error, it is saved in the system and after sequencing all 8 fascias of the request, the group of fascias are thrown away and the right ones are repicked by any picker available.
5- To run tests, make sure you add the files of junit to the path of the project. If those files are not saved on your computer, I saved copies of them in the repository.
