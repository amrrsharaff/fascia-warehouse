To run the program go to the project folder from the terminal and run these two commands
cd src
javac Reader.java
java Reader


NOTES:
1- The 16orders.txt was edited so now it does not have the phase where the picker goes to marshalling.
2- The numbers in the 16orders.txt file represent the fascia number to be picked not the SKU.
3- To trigger an error in the code, you can change the number picked by the picker to another number between 1 and 8 inclusively. If you change the numbers to some numbers outside the scope the program might not work.
4- The system involves only one loader since the warehouse only needs one loader which will use the forklift to carry the fascias into the truck.
5- Make sure that you have the Java unit library files downloaded before you run the tests.
